            <h3 class="title">UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEMS</h3>
            <p> Forest fires are one of the major reasons for loss of forest ecosystems and human communities.
                More than 3 million forest land is destroyed every year. In the longer term, they can adversely affect the supply of environmental services, threaten the survival of endangered species, the composition and structure of forests and the soil quality.
                Forest fires can be caused due to natural or human activities but whatever might be the cause they need to be managed properly to minimise the damage to forest.

                    start in low brush (leaves, twigs, grass), and their spreading to the treetops depends on 
                    the contiguity of flammable substances between the forest floor and the treetops.

                    This entails removing the less developed trees and the withering trees. 
                    Thinning in conifer forests is done in accordance with the density charts 
                    that define the number of trees left while taking the age of the

                     Pruning includes the lower branches of a tree up to a third of its height, 
                    2.5m from the ground at most. In recreation areas and along trails (where there is a 
                    higher risk for fires), pruning might be done as high as 4m. This is in order to 
                    remove the lower branches of the tree so that the treetop is separated from the ground.

                    scattered on the ground. KKL JNF is careful about keeping a strip of forest 
                    along the roads free of cuttings and tree waste, for at least 30m from the 
                    roadside, and encourages the residents of nearby communities to use cuttings and

                    After sanitation, thinning and pruning, the cuttings must be dealt with, and in places where 
                    the forest is on a steep slope or far from the road, the cuttings are burned in a glade.

                    Channel treatments can used to modify sediment and water movement in stream channels, preventing flooding and debris torrents that threaten downstream communities and resources. These treatments often serve to slow water flow, 
                    allowing sediment to settle out, and then release sediments gradually through decay.

                    The hillslope stabilization treatment can be done by aerial seeding of annual grasses. This activity has shown limited effectiveness, but remains the only method available to treat 
                    large areas in a short period of time and at a reasonably low cost per acre.

                    Mulching is the most effective way to provide immediate ground cover to sensitive areas, but it also is relatively expensive and difficult to install. Also, a mixture of water, wood fiber mulch, seed and sometimes fertilizer known as hydromulch can be treated. This treatment provides 
                    protective benefits during the first year, even if seeds don’t germinate.

                    Burned logs onsite can be used to create a mechanical barrier to water flow that also traps sediment and promotes infiltration. Dead trees are felled, limbed, cut to manageable size and placed on a contour perpendicular to the direction of the slope. Long tubes of plastic netting filled with straw, known as straw wattles, 
                    often are used in the same way as logs because they are easier and less hazardous to place.

                    In areas where large-scale surface runoff with significant sedimentation is expected, 
                    fences hung with specially designed fabric can be erected.

                    In areas where burn severity has created water repellent or hydrophobic soils, 
                    breaking up the hardened soil layer to increase infiltration and improve conditions for reseeding. This scarification can be done by hand on steep slopes using hand-rakes known as McLeods, or it can be conducted mechanically 
                    using all-terrain or other vehicles to drag a harrow across the ground.
